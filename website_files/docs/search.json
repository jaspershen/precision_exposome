Here we longitudinally profiled personal exposome and internal multi-omics to investigate how the exposome shaped an individual’s phenome chronically for the first time. Thousands of chemical and biological substances were identified in the personal exposome cloud. We performed correlational analyses within the exposome and inter -omics analyses between the exposome and gut microbiome, metabolome, and proteome, respectively. Furthermore, the exposome and multi-omics correlations were cross-validated using clinical test results. Our results showed agrochemicals and fungi predominated in the highly diverse and dynamic exposome, and the individual’s immune system, kidneys, and liver played essential roles in response to the personal exposome. Overall, our findings demonstrated that the exposome interacts with internal multi-omics dynamically and could impact one’s health status.\n\n\n\n",
